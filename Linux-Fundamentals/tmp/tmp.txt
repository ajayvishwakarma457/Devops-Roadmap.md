üîë What is /tmp in Ubuntu?
  /tmp = temporary directory.
  Used by the system and applications to store temporary files (cache, sockets, session data, etc.).
  Any user or process can write here, but only root can delete other users‚Äô files.
  By default, the contents of /tmp are deleted at reboot (or after some time, depending on system settings).

üìÇ Components inside /tmp
  There‚Äôs no fixed structure ‚Äî it depends on what apps/services are running. Typical contents include:

1. Application temporary files
  Programs create scratch files here while running.
  Examples:
    Editors like vim or nano create swap/recovery files (/tmp/filename.swp).
    Web browsers create temp files when downloading.
    Package managers (like apt) may store temporary install data here.

2. Sockets & Inter-process communication (IPC)
  Many daemons (background services) place Unix domain sockets in /tmp.
  Example:
    /tmp/.X11-unix/ ‚Üí socket for X11 display server
    /tmp/mysql.sock ‚Üí MySQL socket (if configured here)

3. Lock files
  Some programs use lock files in /tmp to prevent multiple instances.
  Example: /tmp/.X0-lock (X server lock).

4. Temporary session files
  When you run installers, extract archives, or compile software, temporary working directories often get created in /tmp.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
  /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), with the sticky bit set:
    ls -ld /tmp
    drwxrwxrwt  9 root root  4096 Aug 31 16:20 /tmp
  üîπ The t means: users can only delete their own files, not others.
  If /tmp fills up, programs may crash or misbehave (since they can‚Äôt write temporary files).
  Some systems use tmpfs (RAM-based filesystem) for /tmp, meaning its contents live in memory for speed, and vanish at reboot.

‚úÖ In short:
  /tmp = scratch space for apps & system.
  Holds temporary files, sockets, and locks.
  Gets cleaned on reboot (or periodically).
