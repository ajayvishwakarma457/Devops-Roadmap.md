In Ubuntu/Linux, the /home directory is where all user accounts’ personal data and settings are stored.
It’s like the “Users” folder in Windows (C:\Users).

🔑 Key components in /home

1. User home directories
    
    Every user (except root) gets a folder here:
      /home/ajay/ → for user ajay
      /home/john/ → for user john
      /home/alice/ → for user alice
    
    Inside each user’s folder you’ll find:
      Documents/ → personal documents
      Downloads/ → downloaded files
      Desktop/ → desktop files (if using GUI)
      Pictures/ → images/screenshots
      Videos/ → videos
      Music/ → audio files
      Public/ → files shared with other users
      Templates/ → template documents

  2. Hidden configuration files (dotfiles)
  
    Start with a . and are not shown by default (ls -a shows them).
      Examples:
        ~/.bashrc → user-specific bash shell settings
        ~/.profile → environment variables
        ~/.ssh/ → SSH keys and configs
        ~/.gitconfig → Git settings for that user
        ~/.npm/, ~/.config/, ~/.cache/ → app-specific configs
      These are separate per user (so each user can have different settings).

  3. Permissions
      By default, each user can only access their own home folder.
      Example: ajay cannot read files in /home/john unless given permission.
      Root can access all user folders.


  ✅ In short:
      /home is for user data & settings.
      System configs live in /etc, but personal configs live in hidden dotfiles inside /home/<username>.
