🔑 What is /bin in Ubuntu?

  /bin stands for “binary”.
  It contains essential command-line programs (executables) that are needed for the system to boot, repair, and run in single-user mode.
  These are basic utilities that every user (including root) can use.

⚠️ Note:
  In modern Ubuntu (after 16.04), /bin is actually a symlink to /usr/bin.
  But conceptually, /bin is still considered the place for essential binaries.

📂 Typical components in /bin
  Here are some of the most common commands you’ll find inside /bin:

  🛠 File & directory operations
    ls → list files
    cp → copy files
    mv → move/rename files
    rm → remove files
    mkdir → make directories
    rmdir → remove empty directories
    pwd → print current directory
    cat → view file contents
    touch → create empty file or update timestamp

  📦 File inspection
    file → show file type
    less, more → view files page by page
    head, tail → view beginning or end of a file

  🔍 Searching & text
    grep → search inside files
    echo → print text
    nano, vi (sometimes in /usr/bin) → text editors

  👤 User/system commands
    bash → GNU Bourne Again Shell
    sh → Shell (basic shell)
    su → switch user
    login → start a login session

  ⚡ System utilities
    kill → stop a process
    ps → list running processes
    df → show disk usage
    mount / umount → mount/unmount drives
  
  ✅ In short:
    /bin = essential commands for all users.
    /sbin = essential commands for system administrators (like shutdown, fdisk).
    Modern Ubuntu merges /bin → /usr/bin, but conceptually it’s still "core user commands".
