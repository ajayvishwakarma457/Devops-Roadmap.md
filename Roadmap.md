Tips for Success
  Hands-On Practice: Spin up your own lab on cloud free tiers or local VMs.
  Incremental Projects: Automate a simple web app pipeline → containerize it → deploy to k8s → add monitoring.
  Community & Certification: Join DevOps Slack/Discord groups; consider AWS Certified DevOps Engineer or CKA.
  Keep Learning: DevOps is rapidly evolving—follow blogs, attend meetups, and experiment with new tools.
